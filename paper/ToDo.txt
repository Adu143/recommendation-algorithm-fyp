I've noted down the changes that have to be made.  For the plots, just get the data and plug it into the Book1.xlsx or Book1_without.xlsx approapriately.

Algorithms to be written:
    Algorithm 1: keyValueNodes for categorical data
    Algorithm 2: keyValueNodes for non-categorical data
    Algorithm 3: Creating User Profiles
    Algorithm 4: Dimensionality Reduction of Attributes
    Algorithm 5: Dimensionality Reduction of Values
    Algorithm 6: Computing User Similarity
    Algorithm 7: Clustering the users
    Algorithm 8: Idiosyncratic Rating Prediction
    Algorithm 9: Collaborative recommendation based on user similarity

Figures to be replaced:
    Figure 2: Create an image that illustrates that an edge has a set of common properties.
    Figure 3: The bar graph indicates the weights that users $2987$, $3552$ and $5997$ (from the MovieLens Dataset) have given to the corresponding attributes. - get a similar plot for the users 2987, 3552 and 5997.
    Figure 4: The figure indicates the weights for various dimensions of the aggregated MovieLens Dataset, calculated using the above formula. - redraw the plot for the newly computed data during FYP.
    Figure 5: Relative Attribute Importance for the user 2987 of the MovieLens dataset
    Figure 6: check out the relative value importances of a number of attributes. choosing language here would be trivial, so choose another attribute. and see if we can get a well distributed one.
    Figure 7: fetch all the relative attribute importances for the dataset and plot them.

Section 7.3: Experimental results
    get the plot for user 2987, and explain it in a similar fashion as that of the commented lines.
    compute the graph density and average degree for the item graph and plug it in.
    compute the ratio of RAIs for actors and directors, actors and genres and plugin the values

Arent we considering the value importance for computing similarity? Need to check this out and change the algorithm appropriately.
